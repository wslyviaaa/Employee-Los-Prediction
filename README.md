# Forecasting Employee Retention

This project predicts employee retention using various machine learning models. It is implemented in Google Colab and structured for full reproducibility.

# ðŸ“„ Dataset
File Name: FACTDATA_SEPT2024.TXT

Source: U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) (https://www.opm.gov)  

This dataset was downloaded from the official OPM website and contains federal employee data as of September 2024. It is used in this project for analysis and forecasting employee retention trends.

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The initial EDA was conducted separately and is not included as code in this notebook. However, a detailed report summarizing the EDA findings is available at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G2toOvQCGtXRdchzsnqAkdkQn3cSf-fpi44q3G0BSSo/edit?usp=sharing
